# Carta Challenge (Bonus Included)

### Using API 

The project is deployed on Heroku at https://portfolio-carta-project.herokuapp.com


To take a look at your portfolio on a given day, the request would be https://portfolio-carta-project.herokuapp.com/api/investments, and the default parameters would be on today's date.  You are able to Create, Lookup, and Update previous investments(only the quanitity and cost) 

There are two separate columns of dates: The created date when creating the investment, and the date of trade, so that the user can record trades in the past. The user can also find their portfolios on a given day with the data they entered on a separate day.
